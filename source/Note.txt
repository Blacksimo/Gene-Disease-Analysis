The p-value is computer from the Fisher exact test which is a proportion test that assumes a binomila distribution and independence for
probability of any gene belonging to any set




2.1) Calculate the main network measures for SGI, I and U
a) Calculate the following global (i.e. concerning the whole network and not the single nodes)
measures of SGI, U and I (only if no. of nodes >20):
• No. of nodes and no. of links
• No. of connected components
• No. of isolated nodes
• Average path length
• Average degree
• Average clustering coefficient
• Network diameter & radius
• Centralization



SGI:
• No. of nodes and no. of links: node=88   link=219
• No. of connected components =  1
• No. of isolated nodes = 12
• Average path length = 3.2211
• Average degree = 5.6389
• Average clustering coefficient = 1.0628
• Network diameter & radius = d=8 r=4
• Centralization = 0.2489


U:
• No. of nodes and no. of links: node=4314 link= 8378
• No. of connected components = 1
• No. of isolated nodes = 0
• Average path length = 3.5853
• Average degree = 3.8841
• Average clustering coefficient = 1.1811
• Network diameter & radius = d=8 r=4
• Centralization = 0.2542

I:
• No. of nodes and no. of links: node= 2919 link= 4382
• No. of connected components = 1
• No. of isolated nodes = 28
• Average path length = 4.0548
• Average degree = 2.933881466255567
• Average clustering coefficient = 0.8649
• Network diameter & radius = d=8 r=5
• Centralization = 0.1027


b) Isolate the largest connected component (LCC) of I and U and calculate the following
global and local (i.e. for each node) measures:

GLOBAL

i)
• N. of nodes and no. of links

• Average path length = 3.5853
• Average degree = 3.8841
• Average clustering coefficient = 1.1811
• Network diameter & radius = d=8 r=4
• Centralization = 0.2542


I:
• N. of nodes and no. of links = node = 2891 link = 4362
• Average path length = 4.0548
• Average degree = 2.933881466255567
• Average clustering coefficient = 0.8649
• Network diameter & radius = d=8 r=5
• Centralization = 0.1027
