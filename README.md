# Gene-Disease-Analysis

## Abstract

In this project we analyzed the genes relatives to the human disease *Diabetes Mellitus*. We analyzed the structure of the network generated by their connections and extracted graph and information from two different databases. We also made use of tools called *Erichr* for the **Gene Ontlogies** and **Pathways extraction**. We clustered our **Largest Connected Component** in order to obtain **Putative Disease Modules** and applied hypergeometric test to calculate their pvalue. We finally used the tool *DIAMOnD* to compare our results.
